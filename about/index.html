        <p>Hello, I'm Pernille.</p>
        
        <p>You can call me cuddles, since it has become my name I put on my art and designs. I'm a small artist living in Denmark, learning day by day how to express my creativity through different mediums. Be it from 3d design in Blender to editing pictures with Affinity Photo.At the moment I'm making illustrations for clients, which I do through CPS and Krita. I'm very interested in learning new ways of designing and explore how to illustrate things in new ways. </p>
        
        <p>At the moment I'm learning to create a better website through visualstudios, so for now there will be some steps missing.</p>
